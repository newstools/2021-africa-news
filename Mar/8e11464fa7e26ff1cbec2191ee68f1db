Despite the temporary halt of drilling and other non-essential activities due to COVID-19, Africa continues to hold resource-rich basins with billions of untapped proven oil and gas reserves, with exploration campaigns set to resume in this year and exploration “hotspots” cropping up in southern, eastern and western regions with this, the Chamber finds now an opportune time to provide a first-hand guideline to working towards the next normal.

“From the onset, the global pandemic and the low oil price exacerbated market conditions and in turn, encouraged many energy stakeholders to rethink and re-strategize,” said NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber. “Through engaging with our advisory board members who are also influential and active players in the global energy sector, we want this offering to shed light on what is happening on the ground, its impact on local development and share key steps on how the African energy markets can position itself on the road to recovery,” he added.

The book is now available for pre-order in hardcover and ebook on Barnes & Noble (bit.ly/3uKFfMc), Amazon (amzn.to/3b4cfr1), Itunes (apple.co/3dV8mXp), Google Play (bit.ly/2ZYtqnt), and many more.
