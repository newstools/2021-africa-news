What follows is a broad outline of my vision with the priorities for a second term for which I seek re-election, should I win the endorsement of our Heads of State. In doing so, I am also following the established practice of all candidates seeking this mandate, by sharing it with public attention.

This vision recapitulates the context of its presentation (I). It considers the synthesis of the past achievements (II) and puts forward the programmatic priorities for the next term (III).
