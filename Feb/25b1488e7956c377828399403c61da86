MediaTek announced the launch of its premium gaming chip, MediaTek Helio G95, along with its offerings across the spectrum, including G90T, G85, G80, G70, G35, and G25 chips. Aimed at the premium 4G gaming smartphone segment, the semiconductor company has associated with global smartphone brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Infinix to launch up to ten premium, feature-rich smartphones, powered by MediaTek Helio G series, in 2021.





The powerful MediaTek Helio G95, with enhanced MediaTek HyperEngine gaming technology, features multi-camera support, unrivalled connectivity, and AI Super Resolution for video streams. MediaTek Helio G95 offers gaming enthusiasts faster performance and high-end features like advanced multi-camera photography – up to four cameras with an integrated AI processing unit (APU).
