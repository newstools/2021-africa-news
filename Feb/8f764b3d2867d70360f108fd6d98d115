ALMERÍA, Spain, February 13, 2021/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            After getting his season underway at last week’s Etoile de Besseges, with a 4th & 3rd place on the opening two stages, our European Champion Giacomo Nizzolo will take aim at tomorrow's 183km Clasica de Almeria.
                                Giacomo showed last week already that he has come into the season at a level where he can already be competitive in some tough sprints
                            



There will be a few climbs to deal with in the opening 100km of the race, but the final 75km back to Roquetas de Mar will be mostly flat and fast.

A power lineup has been assembled around Nizzolo, with fast men Max Walscheid and Matteo Pelucchi also looking to play key roles in the late final. Carlos Barbero, Sean Bennett, Victor Campenaerts and Emil Vinjebo complete our 7-rider line-up.

Thank you to our long-time supporter, Sally Cruickshanks for helping to announce (bit.ly/2ZgUC0B) our Clasica de Almeria team.

Alex Sans Vega – Sport Director
Our team is looking forward to tomorrow's Clasica de Almeria. Giacomo showed last week already that he has come into the season at a level where he can already be competitive in some tough sprints. Our expectation is that tomorrow could be such a type of race, so with a strong team here we will be fully committed to racing for the win.
